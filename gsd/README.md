# GSD "Getting Stuff Done" & Ownership

The path for GSD & Ownership complements the Expertise and Influence path. It's typical for most engineering pay structures to compensate primarily around experience and expertise. Experience counts for a lot and we don't undervalue that at PDQ. We also value engineers that are consistently pushing code and delivering value for the customer, and they should get compensated appropriately for that effort.

GSD complements expertise in addition because those engineers that push more code tend to advance their expertise faster. The more we code and enjoy it as a hobby, the more practice we are gettings and the more we tend to enjoy honing our craft. 

Efficiency also starts becoming a natural evolution of coding more. Often, the hobbyists that have a lot of experience tend to move through code and implement features and more complex features faster. 

We want and encourage hobbyists here. If you enjoy coding as a hobby, then work isn't really "work", plus you get a three day weekend every week to have extra time for your own hobby projects or side businesses. Enjoy your long weekends!

GSD & Ownership is broken down into the following areas:

- [Execution](execution.md)  
- [Initiative](initiative.md)  
- [Communication](communication.md)  
- [Ownership](ownership.md)  
- [Maturity](maturity.md)  
- [Prioritization](prioritization.md)  
- [Impact](impact.md)
