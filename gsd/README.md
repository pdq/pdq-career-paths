# GSD "Getting Stuff Done" & Ownership

The path for GSD & Ownership complements the Expertise and Influence path. It's typical for most engineering pay structures to compensate primarily around experience and expertise. Experience counts for a lot and we don't undervalue that at PDQ. We also value engineers that are consistently pushing code and delivering value for the customer, and they should get compensated appropriately for that effort.

GSD complements expertise in addition because those engineers that push more code tend to advance their expertise faster. The more we code and enjoy it as a hobby, the more practice we are gettings and the more we tend to enjoy honing our craft. 

Efficiency also starts becoming a natural evolution of coding more. Often, the hobbyists that have a lot of experience tend to move through code and implement features and more complex features faster. 

We want and encourage hobbyists here. If you enjoy coding as a hobby, then work isn't really "work", plus you get a three day weekend every week to have extra time for your own hobby projects or side businesses. Enjoy your long weekends!

GSD & Ownership is broken down into the following areas:

| Ownership       | Is learning what it means to set project goals. Listens closely to teammates and mentors when sharing thoughts on project timelines and how to plan well defined deliverables and milestones. Often contributes thoughts and sometimes recommends direction that helps the team to define challenging but achieveable goals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Increasingly contributes and contributes often to project planning by suggesting ways to break projects down into smaller deliverables, prioritize the needs of the customer above all else, as well as appropriately prioritze tech debt along the way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Trusted to handle and own complex features from definition through execution with the successful outcome never seriously in doubt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Trusted to own months-long multi-engineer initiatives from definition through execution with the successful outcome never seriously in doubt.

Examples show targets with challenging timelines and the willingness to follow through and deliver.<br><br>\- Examples of communicating early when a task is behind schedule and giving enough notice to the team and leadership when adjustments could be made to possibly still hit the target on time. If there is a trend of missing targets without early communication on being behind and not asking for ways to stay on target, this would be an anti-pattern and disqualify the ability to meet expectations here.<br><br>\- Many examples of owning smaller tasks without support. Gaining traction of being independent for these smaller tasks. | Examples:<br><br>\- Many examples of personally suggesting ways to break down larger tasks into smaller deliverables that exhibit an understanding of what's most valuable to the customer. Smaller deliverables should show how to get value to the customer faster.<br><br>\- Many examples of delivering commitments on time and communicating often on the progress of those commitments. Examples of communicating in standup reflects "progress" on tasks and not a simple statement of what was worked on.<br><br>\- Many examples of owning gradually more complex tasks from start to finish without leaning on others. Requestiing guidance on architecture decisions is expected.<br><br>\- Examples of quickly gaining clarity on needed product or technical definition when needed without getting stuck. | Examples:<br><br>\- Many examples of specific tasks showcasing a consistent ownership of the more complex features and tasks on the team. Executing from start to finish with excellent communication on progress (refer to progress in glossary).<br><br>\- Examples of giving direction and guidance on how to complete a project on time or offering guidance on how to make it happen.<br><br>\- Examples of doing their part to ensure no roadblocks are being created for others involved in the project, and communicating often about roadblocks when they do come up. Does not hide sticking points or barriers that may be holding others back.<br><br>\- Often the one driving towards definition when it's missing. Examples of driving to definition on projects. (Driving the conversation for missing definition with the PM or EM).<br> | Examples:<br><br>\- Examples of owning large inititatives for multi-engineer projects that were entrusted to you. Examples should include clear communication on progress and taking necessary measures to clear paths when potential problems or roadblocks arise and ensure way to deliver on time were explored. Communication on project progress was always clear to leadership with a clear understanding of how well the project was tracking to delivery.<br><br>\- Examples of maturely leading the technical direction of a project. Leading includes hearing all technical options and opinions and maturely choosing the best path forward. This includes taking an honest look at the needs of the customer and leading based on those needs and not taking a personal technical choice.<br><br>\- Examples of finding thoughtful and sometimes creative ways to solving challenges or roadblocks to project commitments.<br><br>\- Examples of gaining alignment with those around you involved in the project. Making the best choice based on all perspectives, and not making choices based on personal preferences.
