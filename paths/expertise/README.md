# Technical Expertise and Influence
Expertise is a byproduct of experience. Expertise is a direct reflection of learning by doing. We can understand a lot intellectually, and know that we are capable of addressing certain challenges when they come. Through solving those large problems in reality, it now becomes your experience.

Engineers who are hobbyists tend to advance faster through these paths of experience. An engineer that loves to code and comes in excited to work tends to move more code and gain experience faster. If you love coding as a hobby and even actively code side projects often, expect to advance quickly. Hobbyists are loved at PDQ!

Technical Expertise and Influence is broken down to the following competencies:

- [Technical Competency](technical-competency.md)  
- [Mentorship](mentorship.md)  
- [Debugging](debugging.md)  
- [Software Design & Architecture](software-design.md)  
- [Decision Making](decision-making.md)  
- [Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)  
- [Planning](planning.md)

Very likely that some larger PRs will need mentorship from other engineers about following code standards and best practices. May routinely name variables incorrect or arbitrary names. Will follow some code standards in every code contribution without guidance.                                                                                                                        | Has learned and memorized most or all of the code standards. At least half of their PRs will have no comments from other engineers relating to code standards. Will regularly post on other engineers' PRs with comments relating to code standards, (ex: we use X not Y in this project). Will occasionally start discussions relating to updating or creating new standards and guidelines. Can explain the \*why\* behind some of the standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Very rarely recieves PR comments relating to code standards as they've internalized them very deeply. Can explain the \*why\* behind almost every code standard easily. Starts good conversations on updating or adding new standards at least once a quarter. Rarely approves a PR without catching code standard inconsistencies and calling it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Almost never writes code which doesn't abide by standards. Deeply understands every standard and the \*why\* behind it. Has contact with other teams in the organization about uniting standards where possible, prominent in any 'guild' type structures which exist larger than individual teams. Regularly contributes to standards documentation, adding more examples, clearer explanations, or new standards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Heavily contributes to code standards documentation, actively mentors other engineers on code standards, helping bring them up this chain, raising their understanding, encouraging them to become involved and buy in. Is extremely active in the PR bucket, calling out not only code standards but also just general improvements to others' code, like clenliness, performance, etc. Investigates automated tooling to help code conformity and brings those discussions to larger teams.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Writes code standards from scratch if a new technology is introduced or code standards don't exist. Presents initial thoughts to department and drives consensus on new standards. Regularly reviews and challenges all existing standards, are any outdated? Regularly reviews publicly available code standards and code style guides from majory industry players and brings that knowledge to the department where useful. Advocates for & implements tooling which takes away human error in deviation from code standards.              |
