# Technical Expertise and Influence
Expertise is a byproduct of experience. Expertise is a direct reflection of learning by doing. We can understand a lot intellectually, and know that we are capable of addressing those things when they come, but having to solving those large problems in reality, it now becomes your experience.

Experience who are hobbyists tend to advance faster through these paths of experience. An engineer that loves to code and comes in excited to work tends to move more code and gain experience fast. If you love coding as a hobby and even actively code side project often, expect to advance quickly. Hobbyists are loved at PDQ!

Technical Expertise and Influence is broken down to the following competencies:

- [Technical Competency](technical-competency.md)  
- [Mentorship](mentorship.md)  
- [Debugging](debugging.md)  
- [Software Design & Architecture](software-design.md)  
- [Decision Making](decision-making.md)  
- [Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)  
- [Planning](planning.md)

Supports new hires or new members to the team in learning the team domain, typically by request from leadership which shows trust from your leadership and team to mentor and support those that are learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Mentors other engineers proactively, and guides people to realizations rather than providing the answer. Mentorship comes through request from other engineers on your team. You are seen as someone to provide guidance for others, and are actively sought out by those seeking help with foundational pieces of the architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Teaches small groups of engineers regarding foundational frameworks, languages, best practices, architecture, scaling, etc used by PDQ and is actively sought out for guidance in those areas of expertise.

The requests are made based on their trust in your growing expertise in the domain as a Senior Engineer.<br><br>\- Strong contributions to the team documentation over the past 6 months. The contributions include significant influence on the architecture and wise suggestions based on Senior level experience.<br><br>\- Large contributions to the more complex projects over the past 6 months that lay foundational work for less experienced engineers.<br><br>\- Others on the team reach out to pair with you or ask suggestion to help on complex projects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Examples:<br><br>\- Engineers on the team would mention you specifically when asked who has influenced and mentored them to grow in the past 6 months.<br><br>\- Architecture suggestions in the form of ADRs, diagrams, or other documents were presented to the team by you and influenced the direction of the projects your team owns. Influence comes in simple and incremental changes that encourage delivering value fast and consistently to the customer.<br><br>\- Contributions to documentation were significant and provided new ways of thinking for the team using strong architectural guidance or extensive and strong guidance on engineering best practices to the level of a Staff Engineer. These include coaching others to keep changes in small increments, reducing complexity of solutions, and writing code that others would consider references for healthy maintainable code.<br><br>\- Engages often in healthy dialogs with team members that encourage others to come up with their own ideas on how to solve problems and allowing people to think differently than you may. In turn, encouraging and developing other's strengths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Examples:<br><br>\- Has consistently guided the technical direction of the team projects to implement and deliver simple but elegent solutions, accomplishing a steady momentum of delivering value fast and often.<br><br>\- Has many examples of cutting complexity and simplifying feature implementation to delivery in small valuable chunks for not only yourself, but for the entire team. Encouraging the entire team to think in small but valuable deliverables.<br><br>\- Guides decision making for the team to quick and concise decisions that are elegant while encouraging healthy dialogs that allow people to feel heard and valued.<br><br>\- Consistent behavior of healthy discussions that allow people to feel free to speak up and valued in their strengths and talents, which in turn encourages the team to speak up more frequently and mentor each other.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Examples:<br><br>\- Others would refer to you as one of the most influential engineers they have worked with and have encouraged them to grow and think differently, and have accelerated their development as a professional engineer.<br><br>\- If asked, you would be referred to often as one of the greatest mentors others have worked with.<br><br>\- You have influenced many in your career and that influence and mentorship has extended beyond the walls of PDQ, into the community or even the industry.<br><br>\- You have guided many teams to be extremely productive with extremely well measured outcomes. Your influence has developed teams to become world class engineers and collaborators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Very likely that some larger PRs will need mentorship from other engineers about following code standards and best practices. May routinely name variables incorrect or arbitrary names.

At least half of their PRs will have no comments from other engineers relating to code standards. Will regularly post on other engineers' PRs with comments relating to code standards, (ex: we use X not Y in this project). Will occasionally start discussions relating to updating or creating new standards and guidelines.
