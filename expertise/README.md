# Technical Expertise and Influence
Expertise is a byproduct of experience, and is a direct reflection of learning by doing. Understanding intellectually can give the confidence and the ability to figure out what we need to, and know that we are capable of addressing certain challenges when they come. Through solving those large problems in reality, it becomes our experience and we'll be able to do it better, faster, and more efficiently the next time.

Engineers who are hobbyists tend to advance faster through these paths of experience. An engineer that loves to code and comes in excited to work tends to move more code and gain experience faster. If you love coding as a hobby and even actively code side projects often, expect to advance quickly. Hobbyists are loved at PDQ!

Technical Expertise and Influence is broken down to the following areas of competency:

- [Technical Competency](technical-competency.md)  
- [Mentorship](mentorship.md)  
- [Debugging](debugging.md)  
- [Software Design & Architecture](software-design.md)  
- [Decision Making](decision-making.md)  
- [Coding Standards](coding-standards.md)  
- [Planning](planning.md)
