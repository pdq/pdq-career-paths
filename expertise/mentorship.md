Supports new hires or new members to the team in learning the team domain, typically by request from leadership which shows trust from your leadership and team to mentor and support those that are learning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Mentors other engineers proactively, and guides people to realizations rather than providing the answer. Mentorship comes through request from other engineers on your team. You are seen as someone to provide guidance for others, and are actively sought out by those seeking help with foundational pieces of the architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Teaches small groups of engineers regarding foundational frameworks, languages, best practices, architecture, scaling, etc used by PDQ and is actively sought out for guidance in those areas of expertise. If a survey were to be asked by the department for the resident expert they would go to for a given skill, they would be at the top of the list specific foundational architecture.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Encourages people to mentor each other, and creates ways for them to do so.
