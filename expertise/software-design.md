Can clearly and simply demonstrate how the changes improved in both areas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Examples:<br><br>\- Has recommended large refactors or rearchitectures to complex architecture when appropriate, without the common engineering tendency to over-engineer or rebuild things unnecessarily.<br><br>\- Has recommended large refactors in small incremental chunks that also produces significant  customer value (differentiating this from developer value).<br><br>\- Has many examples of recommendations for architecture in a way that will reduce complexity caused bugs or issues. The reduction in complexity also clearly takes into account the fault tolerance of the system. This should be at a level that demonstrates a strong understanding of how the complexity is unnecessary and can be simplified due to comprehensive level of expertise.<br><br>\- Has architecture suggestions that reflect a thoughtful approach to addressing resiliency, redundancy and scalability of the systems. Being able to identify and articulate where the system is lacking fault tolerance or redundancy and regularly providing suggestions on how to reduce single points of failure and ways to improve resliency of the system.                                                                                                                                             | Examples:<br><br>\- Is the major source of architectural direction for the overall engineering organization. Has many examples of being that go to person for large architectural initiatives. Is the source of solving large problems with simple but extremely well thought out approaches.<br><br>\- Maintains the architectural vision for the engineering org landscape. Sets long term strategies with phases and collaborates with each team to plan the work to get us there. Does this through a superior ability to collaborate and align teams towards a vision while keeping the company priorities and needs in the forefront of direction.<br><br>\- Has many examples of identifying potential faults across the engineering org systems. Regularly recommends mitigations and solutions to reduce the risks and provides paths to solve them.<br><br>\- Has architecture suggestions that reflect a deeply thoughtful approach to addressing resiliency, redundancy and scalability of the systems. Is able to identify and articulate where the overall system is lacking fault tolerance or redundancy and regularly provides suggestions on how to reduce single points of failure and ways to improve resliency of the system.<br><br>\- Is known in the industry as an expert in certain technologies or practices. May be asked often to speak at large conferences or events. |
